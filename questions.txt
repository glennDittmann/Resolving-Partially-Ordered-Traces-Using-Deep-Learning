would there be any benefit of training the network with the certain logs as well? i think they will only make the obvious mapping of {i} to i more clear

is an rnn the right choice of nerual network architecture? i think so yes, because we have differtent input sizes and time dependency

feed the netrwork events or traces? at some point the network shoould now which events belong to a certain trace
	so feed in a trace event wise (event for event) unti the trace is finished?

embedding or one-hot-encoding for input-encoding and encode on event or trace level or both?
	with embeddings we also had oov buckets for new uncertain sets of activities
